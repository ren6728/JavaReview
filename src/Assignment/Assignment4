3.Define a method to find out if number is prime or not.
The isPrime(int n) method is used to check whether the parameter passed to it is a
prime number or not. If the parameter passed is prime, then it returns True
otherwise it returns False. If the number is less than 1, if(inputNumber<= 1) it
returns false

4.Define a method to find out number is even or odd.
If a number is evenly divisible by 2 with no remainder, then it is even. You can
calculate the remainder with the modulo operator % like this num % 2 == 0 . If a
number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1, then the number is odd. You can check
for this using num % 2 == 1
