39.What are operators?
Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three
operands, and then return a result.

40.Write the types of operators you studied in class.
Arithmetic Operators
Unary Operators
Assignment Operator
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Ternary Operator
Bitwise Operators
Shift Operators
instance of operator
1).Arithmetic Operators: They are used to perform simple arithmetic operations on
primitive data types.

  * : Multiplication
  / : Division
  % : Modulo
  + : Addition
  – : Subtraction
2). Unary Operators: Unary operators need only one operand. They are used to increment,
decrement or negate a value.

  – : Unary minus, used for negating the values.
  + : Unary plus indicates the positive value (numbers are positive without this,
  however). It performs an automatic conversion to int when the type of its operand
  is the byte, char, or short. This is called unary numeric promotion.
  ++ : Increment operator, used for incrementing the value by 1. There are two
  varieties of increment operators.
  Post-Increment: Value is first used for computing the result and then incremented.
  Pre-Increment: Value is incremented first, and then the result is computed.
  — : Decrement operator, used for decrementing the value by 1. There are two varieties
  of decrement operators.
  Post-decrement: Value is first used for computing the result and then decremented.
  Pre-Decrement: Value is decremented first, and then the result is computed.
  ! : Logical not operator, used for inverting a boolean value.
3). Assignment Operator: ‘=’ Assignment operator is used to assign a value to any
variable. It has a right to left associativity, i.e. value given on the right-hand
side of the operator is assigned to the variable on the left, and therefore right-hand
side value must be declared before using it or should be a constant.
+=, for adding left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.
-=, for subtracting right operand from left operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.
*=, for multiplying left operand with right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.
/=, for dividing left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.
%=, for assigning modulo of left operand by right operand and then assigning it to the variable on the left.

4). Relational Operators: These operators are used to check for relations like
equality, greater than, less than. They return boolean results after the comparison
and are extensively used in looping statements as well as conditional if-else
statements.
==, Equal to: returns true if the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side.
!=, Not Equal to: returns true if the left-hand side is not equal to the right-hand side.
<, less than: returns true if the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side.
<=, less than or equal to returns true if the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side.
>, Greater than: returns true if the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side.
>=, Greater than or equal to: returns true if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side.
