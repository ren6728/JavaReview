1.What do you understand by variable?
In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on
information passed to the program.

2.Name types of variables.
String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final
keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable
and read-only):

3.What is the difference between static and instance variables?
Static Variables are declared using keyword 'static',
Instance Variables are declared without using keyword 'static';

All objects of a class share the same copy of static variables,
Each object of the class gets its own copy of instance variables;

Static Variables can be accessed using the class name or object,
Instance Variables can be accessed only through an object of the class.

4.Which type of variable requires a keyword to determine its scope? static

5.Which thing specifies the size and type of variable?
type

Type    Size/Format	          Description
(whole numbers)
byte	 8-bit two's complement	  Byte-length integer
short	16-bit two's complement	  Short integer
int	32-bit two's complement	  Integer
long	64-bit two's complement	  Long integer

(real numbers)
float	32-bit IEEE 754           Single-precision floating point
double	64-bit IEEE 754           Double-precision floating point

(other types)
char	16-bit Unicode character  A single character
boolean	true or false             A boolean value (true or false)

6.Can we use a variable without declaring it?
A variable is a container that holds values that are used in a Java program. To be
able to use a variable it needs to be declared.

7.How can we declare a variable?
you will specify the type, leave at least one space, then the name for the variable
and end the line with a semicolon ( ; ). Java uses the keyword int for integer, double
for a floating point number (a double precision number), and boolean for a Boolean
value (true or false).

8.How can we initialize a variable?
The way of initializing a variable is very similar to the use of PARAMETER attribute.
More precisely, do the following to initial a variable with the value of an expression:
add an equal sign (=) to the right of a variable name. to the right of the equal sign,
write an expression.

9.Make a list of common Java data types.
There are 8 primitive data types in Java:
byte, char, short, int, long, float, double and boolean

10.Which data types are created by programmers and are not defined by Java?
Class, object, array, string, and interface are called non-primitive data types in
Java. These data types are not predefined in Java. They are created by programmers.

11.Java has how many primitive data types? 8

12.What data type would you use for storing the number of students in a class?
long int as the data type since the number of children can be less or more depends
on the school and it will be always in positive numbers so long int is the better
option.

13.What data type would you use for storing the average test score in a class?
we will use here double data type since average marks can be in decimal and can long
depend on the total marks and number of students. So double data type is a better
option than the float data type

14.How would you declare a variable storing the tax rate? double

15.How would you declare a variable that tells the grade (A, B, C, or D) of students?
char

16.List the name conventions you learned in class about variables.
Variable names are case-sensitive. ...
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. ...
If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters.

17.Name the Data type used for an object 'Pen'. String

18.Write a program and declare the variable of each data type you learned in class. Initialize each variable with appropriate values and print them.
variable.class

19.Write a program to print your name, email, address, phone number, and id.
variable.class

20.What do you understand by typecasting?
Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

21.In which type casting Java automatically converts one data type to another data type?
Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type

22.Write a program to convert int to double and print a message stating which type casting you did?
public class Typecasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myInt = 9;
        double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

        System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
        System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0
        System.out.println("widenning casting done!");

    }
    }
23.Write a program to convert double to int and print a message stating which type casting you did?
public class Typecasting {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        double myDouble2 = 9.78d;
        int myInt2 = (int) myDouble2; // Manual casting: double to int

        System.out.println(myDouble2);   // Outputs 9.78
        System.out.println(myInt2);      // Outputs 9
        System.out.println("Narrowing casting done!");
    }
    }

24.Write a program to convert int to string and print a message stating which type casting you did?
Typecasting.class
25.Write a program to convert string to int and print a message stating which type casting you did?

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String name="automation";
           System.out.println(name.indexOf("a", 5));
       }
   }

29.public class ArrayIndex {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           String name="automation";
           int length = name.length();
           int length2 = name.lastIndexOf("n");
           length2 = length2 + 1;

           // Printing the Length using length() method
           System.out.println("Length using length() method = " + length);

           // Printing the Length using lastIndexOf() method
           System.out.println("Length using lastIndexOf() method = " + length2);
       }
